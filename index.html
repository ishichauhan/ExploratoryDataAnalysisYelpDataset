  <h2>Dataset</h2>

  <p>
    The Yelp dataset is a subset of Yelp businesses, reviews, and user data. Yelp has provided this open dataset for use in personal, educational, and academic purposes.
    This is a huge dataset which containts:<br/>
    1)  <b>6,685,900 reviews</b> given by Yelp users<br/>
    2)  <b> 192,609 businesses</b> that are registered on Yelp<br/>
	3)  <b>200,000 pictures </b>posted by the users<br/>
	4)  10 Metropoliton Areas <br/>
	5)  <b>1,223,094 tips</b> by 1,637,138 users<br/>
	6)  Aggregated check-ins over time and other data for each of the 192,609 businesses<br/>
	7)  <b>1,637,138 Yelp users</b> (Yelpers) and their data like number of fans, review counts and many others. <br/> <br/>
     
	I chose this dataset as I fould it very interesting and challenging. This datatset not
	only contains years, names, dates, review counts but also actual reviews (text) given by the users along with 
    photographs added in some comments. I wanted to understand the data as much as possible and try to 
    create some visualizations for every file.<br/><br/>
	The yelp dataset contains 6 Json Files:<br/>
	1)  <b>business.json</b> - Contains business data including location data, attributes, and categories.<br/>
	2)  <b>review.json</b> - Contains full review text data including the user_id that wrote the review and the business_id the review is written for. <br/>
	3)  <b>user.json</b> - User data including the user's friend mapping and all the metadata associated with the user<br/>
	4)  <b> checkin.json</b> - Checkins on a business. <br/>
	5)  <b>tip.json</b> - Tips written by a user on a business. Tips are shorter than reviews and tend to convey quick suggestions.<br/>
	6)  <b>photo.json</b> -Contains photo data including the caption and classification (one of "food", "drink", "menu", "inside" or "outside"). <br/>
  </p>

  <p>
    The data is available online at:

    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
     The above visualizations have shown the general as well as some detailed view of the Yelp dataset.
	 This was my first Exploratory Data Analysis experience. I have learned new thing during the process.
	 I used tableau and matplotlib(python library) for this assignment.</br></br>
	 Yelp dataset is huge with many files. Data anaysis and data cleaning took the most time. There were some null values which I cleaned using
	 Python. Also, I merged and grouped( on Business ID) together the review and business files. I have tried to used different 
	 visuaization like maps, graphs, bars, boxplots, bubble charts to understand the data better. I am able to find answers 
	 to most of the questions I had put up in the beginning, however, there's still more to learn!
